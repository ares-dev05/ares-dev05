# GOLD LION

![](https://github.com/webdevsmart/webdevsmart/blob/main/fullstack.png)

Full Stack developer with awesome web technical skills, hefty product development experience and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment, looking to create world-class web apps of HIGH STANDARD & TOP QUALITY. For years I've had an active interest in the web and modern technology. Being fascinated with its continuous fast progress I set myself for a challenge to become a Web Developer. I enjoy the process of building the web products from scratch. Solving problems and finding the best solutions is a creative process which often pushes us leaving our comfort zone and this is when we are growing, aren't we?
